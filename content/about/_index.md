Derry Alex is a pseudonym. The initial idea was to create a name from two common names. Alex, rooted in the meaning of "protector", came first. It is definitely a common first name, and also serves as a last name. Derry arrived unexpectedly, which means "oak tree" in its Irish origin. Though it is unconventional in general, a random Google search suggested this. When paired with Alex, it creates the abbreviation D.A., which I find pleasant. Sometimes the best creations aren’t fully designed—they’re discovered along the journey.
